# My training in Andersen Lab
Hello! I'm Andrei Vasilev, I live in Budapest and I'm started training in 
Adndersen Lab. I'm interested in this because:
1. I want to be DevOps (strange, isn't it?)
2. I want to be cool engineer
3. I want to grow above myself

My expectations:
1. I'll be DevOps ))))
2. I'll know a lot new things
3. I'll be like a Google )))
